//(6) when you are outside of the head and outside of functions, you can use just two slashes to leave single-line comments like this and you don't need to close

//(7) just below here you see "var," declaring mymap as a variable, then setting your map parameters. You can redefine features of a variable in your code as needed.
//    you could actually name this anything, as long as you call it up the same way each time throughout the code

//(8) note that you might also see "const" used to identify variables in code, when you want a CONSTANT variable. Functionally, these will tend to work similarly in our work.
// (9) here you define the longitude, latitude, and zoom level of the user map when they load the page, then follow with the tile layer you want (here it is mapbox)

//(10) right above here, you see you're adding this tileset and setting the max zoom level of "mymap" 

//(11) this is how you define individual features on the map - a marker, a cirlce, a polygon. You could also call up a variable and point it to a hosted GIS file to load it in.
//(12) note that each popup has preloaded text here. You could also have a variable that points attributes in a dataset to populate a popup; we will do this in the future

	//(15) here you could set the attributes of the popup instead of setting each to specific text
	
	
	//(16)Love Library is formatted here like a geojson file. This is more likely how you would use vector data in your visualizations. Notice that it's Var LoveLibrary...
	//Somebody in class asked if that's common to throw it all in the file. Well, more often, you might want to add a file like lovelibrary.js and load it into your header,
	//and inside that file, you would have your var lovelibrary and all of this there. That would save your page from getting overly long, like this one.
	//That way you would just say L.geoJSON(LoveLibrary,{}).addTo(mymap); and it would work the same as having all these lines:
		var LoveLibrary = {
    "type": "Feature",
    "properties": {
        "name": "Love Library",
        "amenity": "Library",
        "popupContent": "This is a library!"
    },
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",

    }

		color: 'green',
		fillColor: '#f20',
		fillOpacity: 0.5
	}).addTo(mymap).bindPopup("Love Library");
	
	
//(17)note there at the bottom that you "addTo(mymap)" - addTo is a Leaflet function that adds a layer, and in parenthesis you tell it to add it to the variable "mymap," which is where all of your code is written.
